# Cryptanalysis

## Overview

This project walks through the process of solving a basic cryptanalysis problem. The encrypted cryptogram is provided along with the clue that there are two keywords used to transpose the message. Using this infomration, we will attempt to break the cryptogram using various methods.

## Index of Coincidence

The Index of Coincidence is typically used to determine whether a code is monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic, and if the latter, how many alphabets are used. In this case we will use it to help determine the number of letters in the transposed keywords. 

To compute the index of coincidence, we use the following formula:
